  <title>How Newton's Method Works</title>

  <p> Since Newton's method is used to approximate a root/zero/<m>x</m>-intercept of a differentiable function, we must define the function <m>f(x)</m> for which we are trying to solve the equation <m>f(x)=0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to get a visual understanding of how Newton's method works, we begin with a graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>.
  </p>

  </p>

  <p>
    Newton's method always begins with the user making an initial guess for the <m>x</m>-intercept being sought. We call this initial guess <m>x_0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, we identify the point  <m>(x_0,f(x_0))</m> on the function and the tangent line to the function at that point.
  </p>

  <p>

  </p>

  <p>
    We know that the equation of this tangent line is:
  </p>

<p>
  <m>y-f(x_0) = f'(x_0)(x-x_0)</m>
</p>

<p>
  (Make the above an exercise.)
</p>

<p>
  We are interested in finding the <m>x</m>-intercept of the tangent line above; we will call this <m>x</m>-intercept <m>x_1</m>. Note that its coordinates are <m>(x_1,0)</m>. Using these coordinates, together with the tangent line formula above, we can give a formula for <m>x_1</m> in terms of <m>x_0</m>:
</p>

<p>
  <m>x_1=x_0-\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}</m>
</p>
