  <title>How Newton's Method Works</title>

  <p> Since Newton's method is used to approximate a root/zero/<m>x</m>-intercept of a differentiable function, we must define the function <m>f(x)</m> for which we are trying to solve the equation <m>f(x)=0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to get a visual understanding of how Newton's method works, we begin with a graph of <m>y=f(x)</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Newton's method begins with the user making an initial guess for the <m>x</m>-intercept being sought. We call this initial guess <m>x_0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, we identify the point  <m>(x_0,f(x_0))</m> on the function as well as the tangent line to the function at that point.

 <p>
  Newton's method uses the <m>x</m>-intercept of this line as the next approximation to the root being sought, labelling it <m>x_1</m>.
