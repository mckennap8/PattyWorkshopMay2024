    <title>Creating the Formula</title>
<p>
    Here we will derive the Newton's method recursive formula.
</p>
 
<p>
    We know that the equation of this tangent line is:
  </p>

<p>
  <m>y-f(x_0) = f'(x_0)(x-x_0)</m>
</p>

<p>
  (Make the above an exercise.)
</p>

<p>
  We are interested in finding the <m>x</m>-intercept of the tangent line above; we will call this <m>x</m>-intercept <m>x_1</m>. Note that its coordinates are <m>(x_1,0)</m>. Using these coordinates, together with the tangent line formula above, we can give a formula for <m>x_1</m> in terms of <m>x_0</m>:
</p>

<p>
  <m>x_1=x_0-\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}</m>
</p>
